# Quiz 8

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I chose **Machine Hallucinations â€“ Coral Dreams** as my inspiration.  
I believe the effect of this coral dream can be applied to highly fantastical artworks, (e.g., Converting images into particles and combining them with natural elements to enhance 3D animation effects) serving to enhance the atmospheric quality.
This technique lends itself to heightened visual expressiveness, and I believe it would prove most beneficial in the creation of Monet's works.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
To achieve a similar effect, I explored **Creating Classes**and **Pixel Sorter**.  
This encoding technique enables the regrouping and redesign of elements, facilitating batch processing of similar effects and enabling extensive application.  
It is readily achievable without requiring substantial hardware resources. Furthermore, it allows for the combined processing of images and elements.
